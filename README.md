# Montage
Creating a service that reduces the need for editors to re-watch dozens of hours of footage can cut back significantly on the time an editor spends on editing, and in turn, improve project productivity. Additionally, by providing a clean, intuitive, and simple way of cutting and re-cutting footage together, Montage would provide editorâ€™s an entirely new way to edit which would allow them to focus solely on the story they want to tell, rather than the tedious intricacies of editing their footage manually.
